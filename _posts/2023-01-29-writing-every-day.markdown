One of the most important skills in life is writing. It distributes one's thoughts and ideas to other people and it clarifies one's own thinking. Writing well is then thinking well and communicating effectively.

Despite understanding the benefits of writing, we don't practice it enough. This is similar to how we treat reading books, exercising and eating healthy. Just as going for a jog once a month doesn't bring many health benefits, writing once in a while won't make us effective communicators. What's missing then is a system. A system that puts us in a situation where not writing is not an option.

For many years now, I've had a vision for my career and my life. I know exactly how to achieve what I set out to and writing is one of the pillars of that vision. All I'm missing now is a system that will make me write every day. I'll try to figure it out and share my learnings with you.
